            Stable pools allow you to invest with uneven asset ratios without encountering significant price impact.
            <br />
            <br />
            Deposits that move the pool token balances closer to equal ratios will receive a small bonus, while deposits
            that move the ratios apart will incur a small penalty.
            <br />
            <br />
            In instances where one asset in the pool looses its peg, it&apos;s possible to incur severe impermanent
            loss.
